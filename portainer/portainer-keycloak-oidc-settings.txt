Access token URL: https://keycloak.thecloudgarage.com/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token

Once saved., the users will be able to login. However, upon first login the users will not be able to view any environments

Login via the internal authentication as admin and edit the user's role to admin (unfortunately CE does not allow for RBAC)
